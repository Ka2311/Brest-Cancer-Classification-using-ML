# Problem Statement:Breast Cancer Classification Using a Logistic Regression Model

Breast cancer is a significant public health concern, and its early detection is critical for successful treatment. Develop a Machine Learning model for the classification of breast cancer tumors as either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on various features extracted from biopsy samples.

# Python Programming:
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy-to-learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms and can be freely distributed.


# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance of belonging to a given class or not. It is a kind of statistical algorithm, which analyze the relationship between a set of independent variables and the dependent binary variables. It is a powerful tool for decision-making. For example email spam or not. 


# Breast cancer data collection & Processing
The breast cancer dataset used for this project is sourced from the scikit-learn library. It contains a collection of features extracted from breast cancer biopsies, along with labels indicating whether each biopsy is benign (1) or malignant (0).


# Conclusion:
This model can potentially aid medical professionals in making informed decisions about patient diagnoses and treatment plans.
